Chrome opens new tabs in the background by default. Make New Tabs Active brings every new tab to the front immediately, including tabs opened by links, bookmarks, or other extensions.

Keyboard shortcuts
- Alt+Shift+M toggles the extension so future tabs open in front when on or stay in the background when off
- Alt+Shift+S snoozes without opening the popup

Features
- focuses each new tab right away
- works with links, bookmarks, and extension opened tabs
- toggle from the toolbar button or the keyboard shortcuts
- snooze for the number of minutes you choose
- separate states for normal and incognito windows (when incognito is enabled)
- lightweight, zero configuration

Safety
- no ads, analytics, or tracking
- no host permissions or network access
- open source on GitHub under the MIT License
