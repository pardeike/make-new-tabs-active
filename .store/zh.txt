Chrome opens new tabs in the background by default. Make New Tabs Active brings each new tab to the front immediately, even those opened by links, bookmarks, or other extensions.

Keyboard shortcuts
- Alt+Shift+M toggles the extension so future tabs open in front when on (or stay in the background when off)
- Alt+Shift+S snoozes for a moment without opening the popup

Features
- instantly focuses every new tab
- works with links, bookmarks, and tabs opened by extensions
- control it from the toolbar button or the shortcuts
- snooze for the number of minutes you choose
- separate states for normal and incognito windows (if incognito is enabled)
- lightweight, zero configuration

Safety
- no ads, analytics, or tracking
- no host permissions or network access
- open source on GitHub under the MIT License
